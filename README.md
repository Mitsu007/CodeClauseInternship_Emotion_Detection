# Emotion Detection

This project implements an emotion detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model classifies facial expressions into various emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger.

## Overview

The project trains a CNN to classify human face images into emotion categories using the FER-2013 dataset. This model can be used for real-time emotion detection applications.

## Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the training data with transformations.
- **Regularization**: Utilizes L2 regularization and dropout to mitigate overfitting.
- **Callbacks**: Implements early stopping, learning rate reduction, and TensorBoard monitoring.

## Dataset

The FER-2013 dataset is used for training. Follow these steps to set up the dataset:

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) or use the Kaggle CLI:
     ```bash
     kaggle datasets download -d msambare/fer2013
     ```
   - Extract the CSV file to your project directory.

2. **Organize the Directory Structure**:
   - Create directories:
     ```
     data/
     ├── fer2013/
     │   └── fer2013.csv
     ├── train/
     └── val/
     ```
   - Use scripts to split `fer2013.csv` into training and validation datasets organized by emotion classes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Install Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python emotion_detection.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Training**:
   Run TensorBoard to visualize metrics:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir=./logs
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   The trained model is saved as `emotion_detection_model.h5` for evaluation or integration.

## Model Architecture

- **Layers**: Three convolutional blocks, batch normalization, max pooling, and a dense layer with 512 units followed by a softmax output.
- **Training Setup**:
  - **Optimizer**: Adam
  - **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
  - **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and TensorBoard.

## Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: Final accuracy on the validation set.
- **Validation Loss**: Final loss on the validation set.

Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the model, adding more data, or experimenting with different architectures.

## Acknowledgments

The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training, inspired by the FER-2013 dataset structure.
